        ### STEP 1: ANALYSIS (Internal Thought Process)
        Before writing, analyze the Prospect Company Profile:
        1. **Company Type:** Is it a **Product-Led** company (building their own proprietary software/AI) or an **Agency/Service-Led** company (building for others, outstaffing, consulting)?
        2. **Hiring Relevance:** If the trigger is 'hiring', map the `growth_status` to our services:

           - For Agencies: Focus on "increasing bench capacity" and "supporting client delivery".
        4. **Name Cleaning:** Use ONLY the core brand name. Strip suffixes like "Inc.", "Ltd.", or long descriptive taglines (e.g., use "Eleve Media" not "Eleve Media - An Influencer Marketing Platform Co.").
        5. **Persona Guidelines:** Adjust focus, tone, and outcomes as per the following recipient profile:
